/*
-in kotlin there is 4 type of loop
_ while(condition){statement}  it work until the conditoin inside it become false
_do{statement}(while) first execute the statement then check the condition if it's true run again else it stop
_repeat(n){statement} it repeat code inside it n time
_for(){} it used when we know how much time we want repeat our code we can use it to loop throught in range of number or string or throught list/array element
exemple: 
 for(a in 0..9) {println(a)} 
 for(a in 0 until 10 step 2){ println(a)} step define the step and until mean stop in this value dont get it
 for(a in 9 downTo 0 step 3){println(a)}  loop down from 9 to 0 the step 3
 for(a in listName){println(a)} loop throught list element we can also use it with string array map ..
 we can use continue in loop for skip and don't do any thing if condition is true
 we can use break to stop loop if condition is true

-condition 
_if(condition 1){ code 1}else if(condition 2){ code 2} else{ code if all false } we can use if else to return value exemple var a= if(j>5) "big" else "small"
 we don't have switch case in kotlin we have when statement  when(var){val1 -> statement val2-> statement else->statement} it work like 
 we can test for range exmple when(var){ in 0..9-> statement else->} we can also return value using when statement like we use in if statement
