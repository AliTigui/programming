/*

* 
* we declare variable in kotlin using var or val keyword
* variable with var can be change variable with var can't be change they are constant 
* Arithmetic operations: + addition - substractoin /division * multiplication % modulo and we have += *= -= /= %= ++a a++ a-- --a 
* kotlin support string template that mean we can print or put variable in string using $ before variable and swe can also put equatoin in string using ${equation}
  exemple : var a =" 4 + 4 = ${4 + 4 } "
* comparaison operateur are > < == <= >= != and we have === that mean variable have same reference . !== mean they don't have same reference
* logical operateur are || (or) && (and) ! (not)
* Escape sequence: \n \t \b  \r \" \\ \$ ...
* we can use unicode for write char and string  in kotlin exemple var c='\u0026'
* we can get input from user using readLine()!!
